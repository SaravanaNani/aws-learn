What is Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)?
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully managed, scalable, elastic, and cloud-based file storage service designed for use with AWS Cloud services like EC2 instances. It provides shared file storage that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. EFS is ideal for applications that require a file system interface and need to be accessed by multiple instances.
Key Features of Amazon EFS
Fully Managed:
EFS is fully managed, which means you don't need to worry about hardware or infrastructure management. AWS takes care of the maintenance and scaling.
Elastic:
EFS automatically scales to accommodate growing storage needs, without requiring manual intervention. As you add more files, EFS will automatically grow to handle the additional data.
Shared File Storage:
EFS can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances or on-premises servers at the same time, allowing them to share files and data.
Pay as You Go:
You only pay for the storage you actually use, with no upfront costs or minimum fees.
Highly Available & Durable:
EFS stores data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in AWS, ensuring high availability and durability of your data.
POSIX-Compliant:
EFS supports standard file system operations, such as read, write, create, and delete files, similar to local file systems.
Automatic Backup:
You can use AWS Backup to automatically back up your data stored in EFS, helping ensure that your data is safe.
How EFS Works
Creating an EFS File System:
You can create an EFS file system through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or API.
Mounting the File System:
After the EFS file system is created, it needs to be mounted to EC2 instances or on-premises servers using the standard NFS (Network File System) protocol. This allows applications running on multiple EC2 instances to access files stored on EFS.
Accessing Files:
Once mounted, applications and users can read, write, and manage files on the EFS just like a local file system.
Scaling:
EFS automatically scales storage capacity as you add or remove files. You don’t need to worry about running out of space, and there's no need to manually manage the storage size.
Use Cases for EFS
Web Servers and Content Management:
EFS can be used for storing website content, allowing multiple web servers (EC2 instances) to share and serve the same content. For example, if you have a content management system (CMS), EFS can store the media, images, and documents in a shared location.
Big Data and Analytics:
For applications like data processing and analytics, EFS allows multiple EC2 instances to access and process data simultaneously. This is useful when running big data jobs across multiple servers.
Media and Entertainment:
EFS is suitable for storing and sharing large media files like video, audio, and images. Multiple editors or render farms can access the same files simultaneously for collaborative work.
Backup and Restore:
You can use EFS to store backups, and since EFS is scalable, you don’t need to worry about running out of space for your backups.
Containerized Applications:
EFS can be mounted on containerized environments (like AWS ECS or EKS) to provide persistent shared storage across multiple containers.
EFS vs. Other AWS Storage Services (like EBS)
Feature	EFS	EBS
Type of Storage	File-based storage (file system)	Block-based storage (virtual hard drive)
Use Case	Shared storage for multiple instances	Storage for a single EC2 instance
Scalability	Elastic and automatically scales with usage	You need to manually resize volumes
Availability	Multiple AZs, highly available and durable	Availability in one AZ
Performance	Good for general file access, high throughput	Optimized for high IOPS (faster read/write)
Access	Accessed by multiple instances simultaneously	Typically attached to one EC2 instance
Real-Life Analogy
Imagine EFS as a shared network drive in a company:
Multiple Employees (EC2 Instances):
Multiple employees (EC2 instances) in a company need to access the same set of documents (files).
Shared Folder (EFS):
Instead of giving each employee a copy of the documents, the company sets up a shared folder (EFS) that everyone can access.
Access Anytime:
Employees can read, write, and modify the documents, and any changes made by one employee are immediately available to others.
Scalable:
As the number of documents grows, the folder (EFS) automatically expands to hold the new files without needing additional setup.
Summary
Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable, managed, file storage service designed for multiple EC2 instances to access the same data concurrently. It provides shared access, automatic scaling, and high availability for applications that require a standard file system. EFS is ideal for applications like web hosting, big data, media storage, and containerized applications.
