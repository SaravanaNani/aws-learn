Amazon Elastic File System (EFS):
================================

-> Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a fully managed, scalable, and elastic file storage service in the AWS cloud.
-> It provides shared storage that can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances or on-premises servers at the same time.

Key Features:
=============

-> Fully Managed: AWS handles infrastructure and maintenance.

-> Elastic: Automatically grows and shrinks with your data needs.

-> Shared Access: Multiple EC2 instances can access the same file system simultaneously.

-> Pay-as-You-Go: Pay only for the storage you use.

-> Highly Available: Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

-> POSIX-Compliant: Supports standard file system operations like read, write, and delete.

-> Automatic Backup: Integrated with AWS Backup for data protection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How EFS Works:
================

-> Create a File System: Use the AWS Console, CLI, or API to create an EFS file system.

-> Mount to Instances: Attach it to EC2 instances or on-premises servers using the NFS protocol.

-> Access Files: Once mounted, you can read, write, and manage files as if using a local file system.

-> Scaling: EFS adjusts storage capacity automatically based on file additions or deletions.

Use Cases:
==========

-> Web Servers: Share website content across multiple EC2 instances.

-> Big Data: Allow simultaneous data processing by multiple instances.

-> Media Storage: Store and share large files like videos and images.

-> Backup: Store scalable backups without capacity concerns.

-> Containers: Provide persistent storage for containerized applications in ECS or EKS.

EFS vs. EBS:  
===================================================================================
Feature	              EFS	                                       EBS
===================================================================================
Type	           File-based storage	                     Block-based storage
Use Case	       Shared access for multiple EC2	         Storage for a single EC2
Scalability	     Automatic	                             Manual resizing
Availability	   Multiple AZs	                           Single AZ
Performance	     General file access	                   High IOPS (fast read/write)
======================================================================================


EFS is ideal for applications needing shared file storage across multiple EC2 instances, 
with the convenience of elastic scaling and AWS’s fully managed service.
It’s commonly used for web hosting, big data, media storage, and containerized environments.
