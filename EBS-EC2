Elastic Block Store (EBS):
--------------------------

-> Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is AWS's block storage service designed for use with EC2 instances. 
-> It acts like a virtual hard drive for your instance, providing persistent, scalable, and high-performance storage.

========================================================================================================================
2. Volumes: An EBS volume is the actual storage unit attached to an EC2 instance. 
            It behaves like a hard drive but is located in the cloud.

Key Types of Volumes:
====================

-> General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2): For regular workloads like web apps or databases.

-> Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1): For high-performance databases requiring low latency.

-> Throughput-Optimized HDD (st1): For streaming or large data processing tasks.

-> Cold HDD (sc1): For infrequent access to archived data.

Example:
=========

-> You create a gp2 volume of 100GB to store a database for an EC2 instance.
-> Later, you can resize the volume to 200GB without stopping the instance.
===============================================================================================================================

SNAPSHOTS: An EBS Snapshot is a backup of your EBS volume. 
           Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 and can be used to:

-> Restore data: Create a new volume from the snapshot if the original is lost or corrupted.
-> Clone setups: Use snapshots to create volumes in different regions or accounts.

Key Characteristics of Snapshots:
-----------------------------------
Incremental Backups: 
                  
                  -> The first snapshot is a full backup.
                  -> Subsequent snapshots only save changes since the last snapshot (saves storage and costs).

Cross-Region Copying: Snapshots can be copied to other regions for disaster recovery

Example to Snapshots:
------------------------

-> Imagine taking a photo of your hard drive (EBS volume) as it is right now.
-> If something happens to the hard drive, you can use the photo (snapshot) to recreate it exactly as it was.
==============================================================================================================================

 Lifecycle Manager:
-------------------
The EBS Lifecycle Manager automates the process of creating, managing, and deleting snapshots based on defined policies.

Key Features:
=============
-> Schedule regular snapshots to meet backup and compliance needs.
-> Retain snapshots for a specific time, automatically deleting older ones to save costs.
-> Apply tags for easy organization and tracking.

Example:

-> You configure a Lifecycle Manager policy to:
-> Take a snapshot of a volume every day at midnight.
-> Retain snapshots for 30 days and delete older ones automatically.
===============================================================================================================================

Simplified Real-Life Example:
---------------------------------
-> You launch an EC2 instance and attach a 100GB EBS Volume (hard drive).

-> You take a snapshot of the volume as a backup in case of failure.

-> Use Lifecycle Manager to create snapshots every 24 hours and delete them after 7 days.
